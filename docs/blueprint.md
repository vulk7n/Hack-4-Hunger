- Leaderboards: Display filterable leaderboards showing top contributors (solo/restaurant) by donation volume, updated monthly and yearly, using animated counters and bars.
- Smart Notifications: Enable notifications for allocations, arrivals, and status updates, possibly using a tool to reason about which messages are most critical to communicate.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#90EE90) to evoke freshness and sustainability, resonating with the reduction of food waste.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#F0FFF0) to maintain a soft, airy feel.
- Accent color: A slightly brighter green (#32CD32) for interactive elements and calls to action, standing out against the softer background.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for a modern and accessible feel.
- Implement a floating Navbar with a pill-shaped, glass-like design fixed at the bottom, inspired by Swiggy/Zomato, with icons and labels for main navigation.
- Use consistent and recognizable icons, ensuring they are easily understandable to facilitate intuitive navigation, using a green and white color palette
- Incorporate subtle animations like floating cards, Power Coin counter animations, and smooth transitions on the filterable leaderboard, using flutter's built-in animation libraries for pop-up notifications.
